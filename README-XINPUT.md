This is a fallback in case you have issues with [Custom Mapping for Controller Hook](https://github.com/Sewer56/Heroes.Controller.Hook.ReloadedII/blob/master/README-CUSTOM.md).

It is recommended you use [Post Process for Controller Hook](https://github.com/Sewer56/Heroes.Controller.Hook.ReloadedII/blob/master/README-POSTPROCESS.md) with this mod to add support for deadzones and swapping triggers.
